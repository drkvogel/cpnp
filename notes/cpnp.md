Dear Sir/Madam,

Re: Research Software Developer (Ref: 120234)

Though I do not hold an MSc, I believe I have the skills to do this job.

I have been working in the Core Programming group in CTSU for over 12 years, during which time I have done a lot of processing of data in ad hoc formats to data in relational databases, using C++, Python, Perl, PHP and Java. For the UK Biobank project I wrote a program in C++ to convert raw biobank data into a format usable by statisticians. I also have experience of creating web applications using more modern technologies such as Django, Backbone and AngularJS. 

I am fluent in the Linux terminal and git and use version control for all my projects. Though my stats experience is limited, I am eager to learn more as I feel this it is a necessary skill for computing in public health. I have some knowledge of Big Data / NoSQL (non-relational) databases such as MongoDB which could be suited to dealing with large data sets such as the accelerometer data. I am quite active in the local tech community and keep up to date with current technologies, though I have not been able to apply them in my current role.

I am very interested in this position and would like to be considered for it. I look forward to hearing from you.

regards, 
Chris Bird

 I also wrote a "generic communicator" program for the labs which allows users to specify ad hoc formats themselves, removing the need to write new programs.
I worked for several years on Nova, the intended replacement for the admin side of the GALAXY  systems, and would very much like to finish the job without the risk of being reassigned to other projects, which is a possibility while I work in the Core Programming job.
I have a fairly extensive understanding of the GALAXY system – the admin side, at least – and I also maintain the EBCTCG web pages.
