Research Software Developer – G7 – September 2015 2
The British Heart Foundation Centre on Population Approaches for Non-Communicable Disease Prevention (BHF CPNP) is one of several research groups and units within the
Nuffield Department of Population Health of the University of Oxford. The Group is corefunded by the British Heart Foundation (BHF). The Group also receives programme and
project funding from the BHF, other health related charities, UK government departments and agencies, etc. The Group does not seek or accept funding for its research from food
manufacturers and retailers, or from pharmaceutical, alcohol or tobacco companies.
The overall aim for the Group is to carry out research of the highest methodological quality
that has the greatest possible influence on public health policy and practice, as it relates to
the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD).
The Group’s research has, since its establishment, two themes:
1. Cardiovascular disease epidemiology
2. Primary prevention of cardiovascular disease
In the past few years it has identified a new (third) theme that is:
3. Health promotion and environmental sustainability
Further information on the work of the BHF CPNP can be found on our website at:

The Nuffield Department of Population Health (NDPH) provides an excellent environment for multi-disciplinary research and teaching and in the 2014 REF (Research Excellence Framework) was ranked first for research in the area of public health, health services and primary care. NDPH has over 500 staff working in a number of world-renowned population health research groups, including the Clinical Trial Service Unit and Epidemiological Studies Unit (CTSU), the Cancer Epidemiology Unit (CEU), the National Perinatal Epidemiology Unit (NPEU) and other groups working on public health, health economics, ethics and health record linkage. It is also a key partner in the new Oxford University Big Data Institute. The wide range of opportunities for research within the department includes access to very large data-sets from clinical trials, meta-analyses and epidemiological cohorts. These research programmes are well supported by scientific teams which include clinicians, epidemiologists, statisticians, analyst programmers and research coordinators, and by excellent computing and laboratory facilities.
In addition to its research activities, the Department is home to the MSc in Global Health
Science. Students also come to undertake research for DPhil degrees. Teaching is provided
for undergraduates reading for Medicine and for Public Health doctors in specialist training.

The Medical Sciences Division
Research Software Developer – G7 – September 2015 3
The Medical Sciences Division is an internationally recognized centre of excellence for
biomedical and clinical research and teaching, and the largest academic division in the
University of Oxford.
World-leading programmes, housed in state-of-the-art facilities, cover the full range of
scientific endeavour from the molecule to the population. With our NHS partners we also
foster the highest possible standards in patient care.

The University
The University of Oxford is a complex and stimulating organisation, which enjoys an
international reputation as a world-class centre of excellence in research and teaching. It
employs over 11,000 staff and has a student population of over 22,000.
Our annual income in 2013/14 was £1,174.4m. Oxford is one of Europe's most innovative
and entrepreneurial universities: income from external research contracts exceeds £478.3m
p.a., and more than 80 spin-off companies have been created.
Oxford is a collegiate university, consisting of the central University and colleges. The central
University is composed of academic departments and research centres, administrative
departments, libraries and museums. There is a highly devolved operational structure, which
is split across four academic divisions, Academic Services and University Collections and
University Administrative Services. For further information, please see:

Work Programme
We are conducting research on computational methods to extract meaningful information
from very large health datasets. For example, physical activity is a key health behaviour
associated with a range of chronic diseases and premature mortality worldwide. One of the
many datasets we use, UK Biobank, aims to provide new insights on population physical
activity behaviour through collecting two hundred million raw accelerometer readings from
each of its 100,000 participants. We are developing machine learning methods to extract
precise physical activity phenotype information from such complex accelerometer data.
This exciting research involves close collaboration with cardiovascular disease and physical
activity experts at the Nuffield Department of Population Health and machine learning
experts at the Institute of Biomedical Engineering.

We are seeking an ambitious and enthusiastic individual who is looking to develop a career
at the intersection of computer science and medicine. The role requires strong software
Research Software Developer – G7 – September 2015 4
development skills and the ability to work with world-leading computing and medical
researchers. The main duties involve the preparation and management of wearable camera
and accelerometer datasets, and supporting researchers who wish to access these
resources.
There will also be the opportunity to contribute to machine learning analysis of wearable
sensing health data. This will include the release of open-source software plus contributing
to articles in leading peer-reviewed biomedical journals.
The post will initially be based in the Nuffield Department of Population Health, and involve
